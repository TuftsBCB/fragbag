There are 6 matrix files: each has 2930 lines, and each line has 2930 entries.
The ith line is for the distances to the ith domain (the distances are SAS).
The matrices are upper triangular (i.e. you need to add them to the transpose to get all distances).
You need to take these 6, and take the best-of-all, i.e. the lowest SAS found by any of the six methods.

The labels of the 2930 domains is given in the file cath_domain_labels (the order in this file is the order in the matrices).
